                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>I am a passionate and creative front-end web developer with a keen eye for design and a strong focus on crafting user-friendly interfaces.
                   I specialize in creating responsive and interactive websites using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React.
                   My goal is to combine aesthetics with functionality to deliver exceptional user experiences.

                    <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
                    <p>
                        I created a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey as a front-end web developer.
                        The portfolio was built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with GSAP utilized for engaging animations.
                        It features a fully responsive design, ensuring seamless viewing across devices, and includes interactive project previews to highlight my work effectively. Additionally, I implemented smooth scrolling animations for an enhanced user experience.
                        One of the key highlights of this project was developing a functional contact form with built-in validation, which I integrated with an email service to streamline communication.

                    <h3>Blog Platform</h3>
                    <p>
                        I developed a blogging platform designed to empower content creators to share their thoughts and ideas with ease.
                        Built using Vue.js for the front-end and SCSS for styling, the platform delivers a sleek and responsive user interface.
                        The back-end, powered by Node.js, supports robust APIs for handling user authentication, post creation and editing, and comment functionality. A mobile-first design approach was emphasized to ensure optimal readability and usability across all devices.
                        This project highlights my ability to create dynamic and user-centric web applications that prioritize functionality and accessibility.
